## Compatibility with Other Chromium Browsers

This extension is built using standard WebExtension APIs and should be compatible with other Chromium-based browsers that support these APIs, such as:

- **Microsoft Edge**: You can install the extension directly from the Chrome Web Store or by following the manual installation steps in Edge.
- **Brave**: Brave supports Chrome extensions, and you can install Data Tracker from the Chrome Web Store or manually.
- **Vivaldi**: Vivaldi is also compatible with Chrome extensions, and the installation process is the same.
- **Opera**: Opera can install Chrome extensions with the help of the "Install Chrome Extensions" addon.

While the extension is expected to work in these browsers, it is only officially tested and supported on Google Chrome.
